The data in this folder is the newest and should be good. 

Note the oscilliscope snapshots are all together. So the first half should be at 9900Hz while the second half should be at 6700ish. 

One thing to note is that the maximum of the amplitude appears to jump by a factor of 10 in both cases. 

The bifurcation .gif for the quasiperiodic bifurcation appears to move around, but this is due to the quasiperiodic nature.
The triggering occurs on the oscilliscope's phase and when the new frequency is not a rational multiple (i.e. quasiperiodic), 
obviously we will never be able to actual trigger the waveform at the same point... (i.e. it is not periodic)
