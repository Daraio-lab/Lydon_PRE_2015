The tongue data was aquired in two separate runs. I did them in parts so that I could check the output file after the first part to make sure to not waste time waiting for the second part. 

I think the data is quite good. Note, the matlab file is the data put together, use logarithmic scaling to enhance the bifurcation borderline. 

I have saved the plots that I feel are the best for illustrating the bifurcation behavior. I find it quite interesting mode of bifurcation. 
On the low frequency end of the tongue, where the system must be driven to higher amplitudes the contrast before and after the bifurcation is strongest. 
Basically the systems solutions are farther away from the linear solution and the "jump" is farther. This is quite remarkable, at frequencies close to the sum or linear combination,
the bifurcation happens quickly and the system has bifurcated, but is closer to the old solution.
