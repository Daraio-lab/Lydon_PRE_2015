There are two mode bending profiles, one from before and one from afterwards. I believe they are both good. The one from afterwards should be the most accurate.



The three plot files are all the same data just imaged in slightly different ways. I suggest looking at the imagesc image for clarity. It displays how the modes bend. 

Note the system was driven almost to the point of a bifurcation at primary resonance.
